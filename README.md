# Alien-Invasion- 
Alien invasion is a clone of popular arcade game with same name. I created this game by following the "Python Crash Course" book. The reason was to improve my python skills

Alien Vision is a Python-based graphical project using Pygame to create an extraterrestrial visual effect. In this game, the player pilots a spacecraft positioned at the bottom center of the screen. Using the arrow keys, the player can navigate left or right, while pressing the spacebar fires projectiles at incoming alien fleets.

As the game begins, a wave of extraterrestrial invaders fills the sky, moving systematically across and downward. The player's objective is to eliminate all aliens before they descend too far. Successfully clearing the screen summons a new, faster-moving fleet, increasing the challenge. However, if an alien collides with the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life. With only three ships available, the game concludes upon depletion of all lives.
